    <p>I expect this course to teach me many different tools/frameworks for developing the frontend, and to learn how to properly use the backend.</p>
    <p>My ultimate goal in this class is to collect all the XP and become the strongest character I can be!</p>

    <p>I have lots of HTML and Javascript experience, esecially with React, thus I am hoping to learn new frameworks...</p>
    <p>Especially learning more about the backend because that is what I have the least amount of experience in.</p>
